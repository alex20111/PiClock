Possible problem: if we are waiting to turn the WIFI down because of radio and the LDR change from night to day. Then we don't need to shut down wifi anymore.
LDR workser, initialise the CYCLE to a valid value and not NONE.
TODOOOOO --> verify that we do not override the auto shutdown screen check box in the config.. The autoshutdown method is called without checking the config checkbox (isAutoOffScreen). This can cause the screen to shutdown even if we did not check the checkbox in the config panel (set to false).

implement radio and fix the screen view. Disable buttos of radio when wifi not connected.
Add background for night.. Use LDR to see if it's night but don't turn off the wifi or screen. Maybe add option to turn off wifi........

Tests: 
	1- wifi turn off when screen is off.. (3 min)
	2- LDR status on light. Turn off monitor. LDR take precedence. So if LDR says hat monitor should be off, then the monitor will shutdown after 1 min.
	3- Weather fetch automatically.
	4- everthing turn off properly when wifi is down.
